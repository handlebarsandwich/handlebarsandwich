:raising_hand_man: My name is Nathan Friedman.  I'm an engineer, innovator, inventor, skier, biker, dad, and all-around curious person.  Although my background is mechanical and medical device engineering, I tend to be a little bit all over the place with my projects.  

* Home automation
* Wood working
* 3D printing
* Backyard chickens
* And other random things!
